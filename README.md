# AR-test
An ARCore project that generates an object within the camera of a smart phone to create a augmented reality feel, also includes unity animation to create a dismantle and build effect to the object.

The Object that is generated takes in where the user is looking before allowing them to tap on the screen to place the object.

The user is given the ability to rotate the object within the camera space before deciding that the want to continue with the next stage.

When in the final stage the user will be able to use the pinch ability to dismantle the object into its individual parts.

I will be continuously developing this to find new things to do with my newly discovered ARCore skills, my next AR project will include an animated creature
that can move within the AR space.
